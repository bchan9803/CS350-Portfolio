## Bryan Chan - 2024


### Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
- In the final project, we were tasked to create a furnace that will turn on depending on the set temperature and the current temperature. This project is designed to fix the issue of rooms being too cold. The furnace will turn on if the current temperature is less than the set temperature, and it will turn off if the current temperature is greater than the set temperature.

### What did you do particularly well?
- I believe I excelled in having the furnace turn on it's LED whenever the current temperature is less than the set temperature.

### Where could you improve?
- Personally, I can improve in the feature where the timer resets whenever the furnace resets.

### What tools and/or resources are you adding to your support network?
- Using an IDE such as Eclipse, which allowed me to view the comments which served as the program's documentation, was very helpful.

### What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects and/or course work?
- The ability to work in C, is a fundamental skill in Software Development. Because of this fact, I will be using what I learned about C in other projects.

### How did you make this project maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
- I utilized comments and helpful variable names in order to make the project more maintainable and readable to the developer.
